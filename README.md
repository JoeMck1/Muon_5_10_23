-The 48_with_cov_det.xlsx is an excel spreadsheet containing correlated fit results over what has now been established to be an undesirable range of t_max.
-Data_fitting.py is a python script which fits the GEVP output and returns the fit parameters (including energy).
-Data_graphing.py graphs the GEVP output.
-GEVP_functions.py are the fucntions needed for GEVP analysis.
-Main_GEVP_code.py is a script containing the functions from GEVP_functions.py ordered and written into a script which performs the GEVP analysis.
-cholesky_decomp.py contains the functions required to fit the GEVP output using Cholesky decomposition.
