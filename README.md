-The 48I folder contains the raw data for the 48^3 lattice..

-The 64I folder contains the raw data for the 64^3 lattice.

-Data_reader.py reads in data from the h5 files and reorganises it into configurations of correlator matrices.

-h5_analyser_chatGPT.py is script generated by chatgpt which analyses the structure of h5 files, this information was then used to write the Data_reader.py script. 

-GEVP_functions.py are the fucntions needed for GEVP analysis.

-Main_GEVP_code.py is a script containing the functions from GEVP_functions.py ordered and written into a script which performs the GEVP analysis.

-Data_fitting.py is a python script which first contains the functions necessary to perform many fits over all required itterations of tmax, tmin and t0. 
After these functions is a script compliling these functions into working order. The data is then outputted to excel.

-cholesky_decomp.py contains the functions required to fit the GEVP output using Cholesky decomposition

-Data_graphing.py graphs the GEVP output (note this file is messy as it contains many artifacts from me trying to make shaded plots).

# How to use
Everything can be done by importing final_data (from Data_reader.py) and the GEVP_eigenvalues function (from Main_GEVP_code.py) into either Data_fitting.py
for obtaining data, or Data_graphing.py for obtaining graphs.
